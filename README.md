  The aroma of warm pancakes is the most acceptable substitute for an alarm clock for weekends,
but the cooking procedure is precise and time-consuming. So I decided to do this
pleasure more common occurrence - an automatic pancake machine. Besides facilitating delicious mornings,
it would be an ideal accessory to the kitchen interior with its controlled, gradual movements.
The mechanism would create an interesting look on an island counter, centering attention on itself.

### Instructions for starting the project

1) Turn on the gas burners to heat up (1 minute is enough)
2) Put a plate to the right of the right pan (for the finished pancakes)
3) After you have uploaded the code to the microcontroller, plug in the power supply (220 V)
4) Pour the pancake mixture over the left pan
Example: 1 egg, 2 tsp. sifted flour can be a mixture of white and whole grain, 1 tsp. l soda bicarbonate, 400 g of yogurt, or 2 tsp of fresh

The machine will continue its work by turning the pancake and dropping it into the plate
